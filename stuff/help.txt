NODE INSTALLER
Usage: setup <options> command, use --help for information

This is the alternate installer that eventually will replace 
the original baltrad-node setup scripts. The usage is basically 
the same as when using the previous setup commands but this 
script will install everything in one go.

The script will remember several configuration parameters between
runs but some of them will not be stored, like passwords and
similar items. If you want to use the previous parameters, then
you can specify --recall-last-args

Command:
Valid commands are:
 - install
     Installs the software
     
 - check
     Checks that the provided dependencies are correct

 - clean
     Cleans up everything

 - fetch
     Fetch all packages so that it is possible to run an installation
     in 'offline' mode. It will atempt to clean up any unessecary 
     content but it is suggested to execute clean prior fetch.
 
 - dist
     Create distribution tarball
     
Options:
--help
    Shows this text

--recall-last-args
    If you want to use the previous arguments, then you can use
    this option. It will try to restore the configuration parameters
